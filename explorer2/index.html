<h2>Cup Explorer2</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Explore the dungeon and find a cup worthy to drink from. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Snob
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
You use the keyboard to move, there is no randomness, It's an overhead adventure rpg, and its an explorer/collector
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What ever goals I had and easter eggs I planned kinda went out the window when doing sprites took forever. I had hoped to give skeletons 2 health with the ability to to sacrifice one of your health at a demon alter in order to get a damage up to 1 hit them. So I guess my goal is people want to win so they keep playing?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move the character around and walk over certain objects to interact with them. There is a teleporter in the alter room and two types of cups, 4 that get a disappointed response from the character, 1 spawns a skeleton trap, and 1 that wins the game. Death also follows you around, he has 10 health and each time he is hit he spawns skeletons. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Tilemaps
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
You have to collect all the cups in order to be able to teleport to the final cup. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A fantasy world.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In a world where people just want to kill things, all Joe the Explorer cares about is cups. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like flashgame rpgs with puzzle elements
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depends on how long it takes for the person to figure out the secret. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Paying attention to the words given while collecting the cups.
</li>
