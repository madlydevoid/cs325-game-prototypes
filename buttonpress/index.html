<h2>Button Press</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Press the green check button but don't press the plain green buttons
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Find the button.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The spawn for the green and green check circles are random. So you could potentially have an easy time, or the hard time.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Ease of play and a quick playtime.  
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
You can click on the green check circle to gain a point or the plain green circle to lose a point.

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Spawning objects touching on grouping and deleting objects and basic design.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The bad circles are also green which can make it hard to see the correct check marked circle sometimes, the number spawned gets higher as you get more points, another spawn for every 10 points.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is completely abstract, there is no setting or premise to speak of. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Being abstract there is also no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target is people browsing through a flash game sites like newgrounds or the like.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game lasts for 60 seconds before restarting.

Make sure you are clicking the right button, go too fast and you may misclick.
</li>
