<h2>Heart Attack!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid the hearts, you have one life, click to restart.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The hearts are fighting back against smoking, you mush survive. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The spawns come from the side of the screen and their direction is fixed, but beyond that the spawn is random.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A quick few second game, if text was working then it would be to get the highscore.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Arrow keys move the cigarette (you) around. Should you get hit by a heart you lose. Clicking restarts the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Collision physics and more phaser basics.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Nothing really besides the theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a world of organs, the brains are the ruling class and decision makers, while the hearts tend to be the workers. The brains created a synthetic life form called the cigarette. Cruel to the core they pushed around the brains and abused the hearts.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The hearts have begun to fight back against the cruel cigarettes. You play as a cigarette who does not want to be cruel, and just wants to live peacefully. Cursed by your birth as a cigarette, the hearts will come at you till you die.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
